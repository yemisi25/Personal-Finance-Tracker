# **Personal Finance Tracker — Zero-Based Budget Tool (Excel)**

A hands-on Excel budgeting tool created while learning dashboarding, formulas, and data structure. Inspired by an Office Lab tutorial and tailored for personal financial clarity and planning.
---
A lightweight, intentionally built Excel application designed to bring clarity, structure, and ownership to personal financial planning.

This project started as a practical exercise to deepen my Excel skills and create a budgeting system that’s simple, transparent, and fully customizable — no apps, no subscriptions, no locked formulas.
Just Excel.

## **✨ Overview**

This workbook was inspired by an end-to-end tutorial from **The Office Lab** on YouTube.
I followed the build from scratch and customized the logic, formulas, and layout to fit my workflow and aesthetic.

The goal was simple:

> Build a tool I can understand, maintain, and evolve, while becoming more confident with Excel.

## **🧠 What I Learned**

* Structuring data effectively in Excel
* Working with formulas, lookups, and validations
* Building dashboards from raw data
* Breaking things → fixing things → refining the logic
* That problem-solving is a loop, not a straight line

This build reminded me that slow, deliberate learning is powerful — and deeply satisfying.
